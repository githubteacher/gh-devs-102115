- Sugarcane is fun to eat.
- I like to eat wheat rotis.
- Maharashtra is one of the wealthiest and the most developed states in India, contributing 25% of the country's industrial output.
- The major rivers of the state are Godavari, Krishna, Narmada and Tapi.
- Maharashtra was ruled by the Maurya Empire in the 4th and 3rd century BC. Around 230 BCE Maharashtra came under the rule of the Satavahana dynasty for 400 years.[17] The greatest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was Gautamiputra Satakarni.[18] In 90 AD Vedishri,[19] son of the Satavahana king Satakarni, the "Lord of Dakshinapatha, wielder of the unchecked wheel of Sovereignty",[18] made Junnar, thirty miles north of Pune, the capital of his kingdom.

Ajanta and Ellora caves are best places to visit.
